Scratch - A Theme for Ghost
===========================

Scratch began as a from-scratch rewrite of [Glass](https://github.com/echenley/glass), but quickly became its own project. Compared with Glass, Scratch's typography is a little more sophisticated and a lot more serif: Crimson Text for the body and a ligature-equipped Libre Baskerville for headings. JavaScript is kept to a minimum.
